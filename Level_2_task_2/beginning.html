                <h2>A Remarkable Legacy</h2>
                <p>Dwight D. Eisenhower left an enduring legacy both as a military leader and as a President of the United States.</p>
                <p>During World War II, he served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe, orchestrating pivotal campaigns
                    such as Operation Torch and the D-Day landings in Normandy. As the 34th President of the United States from 1953 to 1961, Eisenhower
                    navigated the early years of the Cold War, championing a "New Look" policy focused on nuclear deterrence while also establishing the 
                    Interstate Highway System and leading the creation of NASA. His farewell address famously warned against the dangers of the military-
                    industrial complex, a caution that continues to resonate today</p>

                <h2>Leadership Qualities</h2>
                <p>Dwight D. Eisenhower's leadership was characterized by a unique blend of humility, integrity, and strategic vision. He believed in the
                    power of collaboration and often sought input from a diverse range of advisors, valuing their perspectives while maintaining a clear
                    sense of direction. Eisenhower ended the Korean War, implemented a "New Look" national security policy focused on nuclear deterrence
                    and strategic alliances to contain communism, and established the Eisenhower Doctrine to offer aid against communist threats in the Middle 
                    East. Domestically, he enacted the Interstate Highway System, created NASA in response to the Soviet Sputnik launch, expanded Social Security, 
                    and signed Civil Rights Acts in 1957 and 1960.</p>
